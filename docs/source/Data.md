# Data

FRIDGe utilizes a series of YAML files to describe every aspect of the reactor; from elements to a full core configuration.
Each section below describes the YAML file associated with a particular aspect of the core.
The section will provide all of the variables that are required or optional for the YAML file and any associated units.
This is meant to aid the user if they require building their own YAML file.

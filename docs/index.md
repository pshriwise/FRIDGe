# Fast Reactor Input Deck Generator (FRIDGe)

## Overview

The Fast Reactor Input Deck Generator (FRIDGe) is a tool for designing and building input files for MCNP.
It grants the user the ability to create elements, materials, assemblies, and full reactor cores.
Currently FRIDGe has the ability to create two types of assemblies; smear and fuel assemblies.
A smear assembly can be used to build vacant assemblies in a reactor (to simulate experimental areas or holes from control assemblies).
A fuel assembly can be used to build a multiple types of driver assemblies or smearet assemblies.
FRIDGe currently contains 24 elements which are most commonly used in the development of fast reactors.
Along with this, there are 8 base material for us in FRIDGe.
here are also examples of both assembly and core files.
